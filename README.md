</p>
<p>A dev tool for laying out tile-based patterns, maps, etc.</p>

<p>Renders a two-dimensional, coordinate-indexed Grid in which tiles can be placed, and provides functionality for selecting, moving, and performing actions on (fill, delete, copy, paste, etc.) subsets of those tiles.</p>

<p>Originally created to aid the development of my <a href="https://github.com/nymphofthevales/Keeper-of-the-Labyrinth">Keeper of the Labyrinth</a> project, since that project includes a save file viewer in the form of a branching map.</p>

<p>Intended to become a stand-alone application with an Electron build, capable of importing and exporting .JSON files to represent the tile structure created, as well as user-defined tilesets to work with in the GUI.</p>

<p>Currently in development.</p>
