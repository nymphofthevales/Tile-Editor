Work in progress. A dev tool for laying out tile-based patterns, maps, etc. Renders a two-dimensional, coordinate-indexed Grid in which tiles can be placed, and provides functionality for selecting, moving, and performing actions on (fill, delete, copy, paste, etc.) subsets of those tiles.

Originally created to aid the development of my Keeper of the Labyrinth project, since that project includes a save file viewer in the form of a branching map.
Intended to become a stand-alone application with an Electron build, capable of importing and exporting .JSON files to represent the tile structure created, as well as user-defined tilesets to work with in the GUI.
